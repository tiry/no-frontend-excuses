## What is this about ?

This is a very basic coding test.

You have :

 - an implementation javascript file where you must fill the blanks (`tester.js`)
 - a unit test javascript file that tells you what is the expected behavior and what cases are tested (`spec.js`)

The goal is of course to make all unit tests pass !

## How code and run the tests

If you are a javascript developer, you should find out quickly how to run the tests.

Just in case :

  - you need to use bower to *"build"*
  - you can run the unit tests using a browser 

## Rules and expected result 

The goal is to have all unit tests passing.

 - Time  : this is not a race, but it is expected that implementation should not take more than 1 hour 
 - Implementation : of course, having a rather clean implementation does matter
